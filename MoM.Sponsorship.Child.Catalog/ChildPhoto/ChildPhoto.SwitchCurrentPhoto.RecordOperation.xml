	Remarks:    
		TK-01177
		Create a task on the child photo tab in the action tasks for the attachments.  
		It will look at the "profile photo year" and find the old photo title that begins with the year. 
		It will change the photo type to "current".
		 - Look for the photo attachment with the title that starts with "profile photo year", change the headshot & full body to "-Current" as the photo type,
		 - Change the existing headshot & full body that is now "-Current" to not current.

	08-Jan-2014		Memphis			Initial Version
	17-Mar-2014		Memphis			Fixing bugs discovered by Pamela:
										- If the profile photo year is the same as the year in the title field, do nothing.  
										-   If possible, display a message saying the current photo matches the profile photo year.
										- If the profile photo year does not match any of the years in the title field, do nothing.  
										-   If possible, display a message saying there are no photo attachments that belong to the same years as the profile photo year.
	26-Mar-2014		CMayeda			D-01109 - Added cast to fix implicit casting see comment ** ADDED CAST **
									Also see note: ** THIS WON'T WORK IF OTHER TYPES OF ATTACHMENTS (NON CHLID PHOTO) START WITH A YEAR **
