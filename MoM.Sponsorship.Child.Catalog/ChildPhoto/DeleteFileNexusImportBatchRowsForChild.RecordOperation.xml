	12-Jul-2016		Memphis			Initial creation. This is used as a short-term solution to allow deleting a Child that may have a FK constraint
										conflict when trying to delete.  This will delete the records in the 
										USR_FILENEXUSPHOTOYEAR_IMPORTBATCH table for the given child.
									This is a copy of the built-in sproc that deletes by ID with ChangeAgentID
