	<!-- 
	Remarks:	The 'Completing Program in 12 Months' pending reason is added if the child/children are within 12 months (@CompletionDateThreshold) of their Current Completion Date
				Also, the child needs to not be sponsored.
	
				This is called from USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITYCHECK, which is used by both the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Check record operation 	
				and with the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Business Process.  As such it needs to be able to handle a single Sponsorship Opportunity Child and
				a Sponsorship Opportunity selection.
