	<!-- 
	Remarks:	The 'Project on Phasing Out Status' pending reason is added if the child's/children's project is set to Inactive, Pending - Under Investigation
				Also, the child needs to not be sponsored.
	
				This is called from USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITYCHECK, which is used by both the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Check record operation 	
				and with the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Business Process.  As such it needs to be able to handle a single Sponsorship Opportunity Child and
				a Sponsorship Opportunity selection.  
				
				This is accomplished with the @ID and @IDSetRegisterID parameters.
				If @ID is not null, then the sproc uses @ID to specify the Sponsorship Opportunity ID
				If @ID is null, then the sproc uses @IDSetRegisterID to specify the collection of children to check.
