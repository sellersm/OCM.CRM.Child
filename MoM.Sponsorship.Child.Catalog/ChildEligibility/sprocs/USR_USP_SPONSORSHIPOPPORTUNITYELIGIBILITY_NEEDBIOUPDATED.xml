	<!-- 
	Remarks:	The 'Need Bio Updated' pending reason is added to the child/children if a Child Bio note exists and it is over two years old, this is set in @BioValidAge (which is in months)
				If no Child Bio note exists, the 'Need Bio Updated' pending reason should not be on the child, because it will have the 'Need Bio Created' pending reason.
				
				This is called from USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITYCHECK, which is used by both the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Check record operation 	
				and with the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Business Process.  As such it needs to be able to handle a single Sponsorship Opportunity Child and
				a Sponsorship Opportunity selection.
