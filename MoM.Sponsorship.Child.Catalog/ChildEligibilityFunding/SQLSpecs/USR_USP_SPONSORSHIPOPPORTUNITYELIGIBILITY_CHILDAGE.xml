	Description="Used to add/delete 'Child is 16 years or older' pending reasons."
	Author="Cary Mayeda"
	SPName="USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITY_CHILDAGE"	>

	<!-- 
	Remarks:	The 'Child is 16 years or older' pending reason is added if the child/children are over 16.5 years, which @maxValidAge is set to (in months)				
				
				This uses UFN_DATE_EARLIESTFROMFUZZYDATE to convert the birthdate (estimate or actual) to a datetime.  
				It uses the first day of the month if not specified and January if the month is not specified.
	
				This is called from USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITYCHECK, which is used by both the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Check record operation 	
				and with the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Business Process.
