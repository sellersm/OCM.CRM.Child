	Author="Cary Mayeda"

	<!-- 
	Remarks:	The 'Project on pending status' pending reason is added if the child's/children's project is set to Inactive, Pending - Under Investigation
				Also, the child needs to not be sponsored.
	
				This is called from USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITYCHECK, which is used by both the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Check record operation 	
				and with the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Business Process.  
				
	History:
	Date			Modified By		Comments
