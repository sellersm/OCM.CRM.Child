	<!-- 
	Remarks:	The 'Current attachments have different title years' pending reason is added to the child/children if the year in the title of the Current Headshot photo attachement
				does not match the year in the title of the Current Fullbody photo attachment
				title prefix on the current headshot attachment.
	
				This is called from USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITYCHECK, which is used by both the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Check record operation 	
				and with the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Business Process.  As such it needs to be able to handle a single Sponsorship Opportunity Child and
				a Sponsorship Opportunity selection.  
				
				This is accomplished with the @ID and @IDSETREGISTERID parameters.
				If @ID is not null, then the sproc uses @ID to specify the Sponsorship Opportunity ID
				If @ID is null, then the sproc uses @IDSETREGISTERID to specify the collection of children to check.
