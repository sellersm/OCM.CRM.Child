	<!-- 
	Remarks:	The 'Project on phasing out status' pending reason is added if the child's/children's project is set to Inactive, Pending - Under Investigation
				Also, the child needs to not be sponsored.
	
				This is called from USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITYCHECK, which is used by both the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Check record operation 	
				and with the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Business Process.  
				
	History:
	Date			Modified By		Comments
    28-Mar-2012		CMayeda			Initial Version
	31-Jul-2012		CMayeda			Changed this to take a table instead of the ID or @IDSETREGISTER ID
	14-Aug-2012		CMayeda			Added code to remove Ineligible kids from the insert (except Waiting List kids)
	13-Oct-2012		CMayeda			Updated Pending reason to the all lower case except first letter standard
