	<!-- 
	Remarks:	The 'Need photo updated' pending reason is added to the child/children if a child photo exists and is too old.
	
				This is called from USR_USP_SPONSORSHIPOPPORTUNITYELIGIBILITYCHECK, which is used by both the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Check record operation 	
				and with the Sponsorship Opportunity Eligibility Business Process.  As such it needs to be able to handle a single Sponsorship Opportunity Child and
				a Sponsorship Opportunity selection.  
				
				This is accomplished with the @ID and @IDSETREGISTERID parameters.
				If @ID is not null, then the sproc uses @ID to specify the Sponsorship Opportunity ID
				If @ID is null, then the sproc uses @IDSETREGISTERID to specify the collection of children to check.
